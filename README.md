# Handling Form Submission

This project demonstrates how to use **Spring Framework** to create and handle web form submissions.

## What You Will Build

This application includes:

- A **web form** accessible at: [http://localhost:8080/greeting](http://localhost:8080/greeting).
- A **form submission process** where users can input an ID and a message.
- A **results page** displaying the submitted data after the form is submitted.

## How It Works

1. Access the form by navigating to [http://localhost:8080/greeting](http://localhost:8080/greeting) in your browser.
2. Populate the fields:
    - `id`: An identifier for the greeting.
    - `content`: A message to submit.
3. Submit the form to view the results page, which displays the entered data.
4. Optionally, use the provided link to submit another message.

## Key Features

- Built using **Spring Boot** for rapid development.
- Uses **Thymeleaf** for rendering views and handling form data.
- Includes examples of GET and POST endpoints with form handling.
